The purpose of this personal website is to tell visitors who I am and what I can do.
Contacting me in the above webapp in the 'Contact' section is the best way to reach me.
Below are the open source 'cool' pieces I used if you would like to use them in isolation.

## Client Side 
```
Bootstrap Scrollspy
Google Fonts Text
Banner Background
jQuery Slow Scroll
```

## Server Side
```
Node
Express
Node Mailer
Google reCaptcha v2
Github Dependabot
```

The application is 'logically' running in a Heroku Dyno which is 'physically' running on an AWS node.
This Heroku Dyno is secured with an SSL so that contact information sent is secure during transit.
