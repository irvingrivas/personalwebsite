# Personal Website

The purpose of this personal website is to tell visitors who I am and what I can do.

If you would like to use my site as a template, I would greatly appreciate it if you email me for permission.

Below are the open source 'cool' pieces I used if you would like to use them in isolation.

```
Bootstrap Scrollspy
CSS5 dynamic page and content resizing (vh,vw)
CSS5 flexbox
Google Fonts Text
Banner background
jQuery Slow Scroll "easeInOutQuad"
```
